Day-1
=======  

## Spring Basics, Spring Boot , Micro services ##

Pre requisites:

Core Java, OOPS, JDBC

## What is prog lang , technology and framework? ##

- C, C++, Java : prog lang
- JDBC, Servlet, JSP , EJB etc : Technlogies
- Spring, Hibernate, Struts, JSF: Frameworks.

Technology API gives:

- Interfaces --> representing rules

(When class implements an interface, all the methods of interface must be implemented)

- Concrete classes --> representing Guidelies

(You may or may not use super class methods in subclass)

- abstract classes --> representing both rules and guidelines

()

## From Java 8 ##

- Interfaces also represent rules and guidelines.

## Spring JDBC ##

Create JDBC template class object (takes care of common logics)

- Send and executes SQL Queries in DB software.
- Gather results and process results.
- So, there is no boilerplate problem, programmers just need to develope only app specification logics.

# Different types of Java Framework #

## 1. Web application frameworks/ Web frameworks / MVC Architecture  ##


- Provides abstraction  on servlet , jsp technologies and simplifies the mvc architecture based java web application development.

struts --> from Apache
Spring MVC --> from interface21 (Pivotal Softwares)
JSF --> Oracle
Tapstrey --> Adobe

## 2. ORM Framework  ##

- Provides abstraction on JDBC Technology and simplifies to develope object based db software independent persistent logic.

Eg:

- Hibernate --> from redHat
- IBatis --> from Apache
- Eclipse Link --> from Eclipse
NOTE : Spring ORM is not giving its own ORM framework, but it is providing Spring ORM , Spring data JPA modules, providing abstraction on other ORM frameworks, mainly Hibernate.

## 3. Application Framework  ##

- Provides abstraction on multiple Java, JEE technologies and simplifies all kinds Java/JEE app development.

Eg: Spring --> by Pivotal 


- Spring framework provides abstraction on multiple Java, JEE technolgies like JDBC, JNDI Servlet JSP , EJB Java Mail, JMS etc.

- Using spring we can develope standalone app, web app, distributed apps, enterprise app etc.

- Using Spring, we can develope presentation logics, business logics, persistence logics, integration logics etc.


Eg: browser >--> FlipKart >--> Paypal >--> Visa >--> SBI

   --web app---Distributed app------Distributed app------Distributed app---

   - Web app is a client server app where client is browser and server is software app.

- We can develope Spring Apps in 4 approaches:

1. Using XML driven configs
2. Using Annotation driven configs
3. Using 100% code driven configs
4. Using Spring Boot env.



Day-3
======


Based on kind of application we develope, there are multiple java frameworks:

- Web application framework
- ORM framework
- Application framework
- Distributed application framework
- Big data framework

## 4. Distributed Application Framework  ##

- Distributed app is a client server app where both client and server apps are programmable softwares.

Eg: PayTM, PayPal, Weather Report etc.

=> RMI, EJB are outdated technologies to develope distributed applications.
=> WebServices is the software env to develope distributed apps in different env like Java, .Net etc.
=> The webServies developed in java env. can be consumed in java itself or in some technology client apps like .Net, php, android etc. This feature is called inter-operability.

#### 2 types of webServies implementation is possible: ####

- SOAP based web services (SOAP= Simple Object Access Protocol) 
    1. jax-rpc
    2. jax-ws
    3. axis etc

- RESTful Web services
    1. Spring REST
    2. Jax-rs


Machine 1(B.computer.B.m1()) ----> network ------> Machine 2(B.computer), B.m1(){...}





### 5. Big Data Framework ###

- The data that is beyond storing and processing capacity is called BigData.
- Big Data frameworks are given to store and process huge amount of data with ordinary computers and storage devices with support of distributed data storage and processing algorithms.

What id Java Bean?
====================

- Java Bean is a java class that developed by following some stamdards.
- Java Bean is always used as helper class to pass multiple values from one java class to another class that are there either in same project or in 2 different projects.

Eg: Flipkart passes card detail to paypal as java bean class object
=> Paypal passes payment transaction details back to Flipkart as another java bean class object.


The Standards are:

1. Class must be public.
2. Recommended to implement Serializable Interface.
3. All member variables (properties) must be private and non-static.
4. Every property must have 1 setter method and 1 getter method.
5. There should be one zero param constructor in the class directly (given by programmer) of indirectly (generated by compiler).
